## Memory

``` -Xms<int> -Xmx<int> ```

Replace int with a value. For example: -Xmx<2G>, -Xms<512M>
Append the letter k or K to indicate kilobytes, m or M to indicate megabytes, g or G to indicate gigabytes

- ### Xms
    Sets the minimum and the initial size of the heap. It is best to set Xms equal to Xmx (the maximum heap size) to minimize potentially costly heap reallocations.

- ### Xmx
    Sets the maximum size of the heap. Setting it to higher amounts reduces the frequency of garbage collections but causes larger lag spikes when the garbage collector runs. It is best to set this value to about half of the memory available on your system. Allocating any more memory than half will probably slow down your system significantly and may even result in your system crashing.

## Garbage Collectors

- ### Serial Garbage Collector
    The serial collector uses a single thread to perform all garbage collection work, which makes it relatively efficient because there is no communication overhead between threads. It is best-suited to single processor machines, because it cannot take advantage of multiprocessor hardware, although it can be useful on multiprocessors for applications with small data sets (up to approximately 100 MB). 
    <br> The serial collector can be enabled with the option ```-XX:+UseSerialGC```.

- ### Parallel Garbage Collector
    The parallel collector (also known as the throughput collector) performs minor collections in parallel, which can significantly reduce garbage collection overhead. It is intended for applications with medium-sized to large-sized data sets that are run on multiprocessor or multithreaded hardware. 
    <br> The parallel collector can be enabled with the option ```-XX:+UseParallelGC```.

### Mostly Concurrent Garbage Collectors
The mostly concurrent collectors perform most of their work concurrently (for example, while the application is still running) to keep garbage collection pauses short.

- #### Concurrent Mark Sweep Collector
    The Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) collector is designed for applications that prefer shorter garbage collection pauses and that can afford to share processor resources with the garbage collector while the application is running. Typically applications that have a relatively large set of long-lived data and run on machines with two or more processors tend to benefit from the use of this collector. However, this collector should be considered for any application with a low pause time requirement. 
    <br> The CMS collector is enabled with the command-line option ```-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC```.

- #### Garbage-First Garbage Collector
    The Garbage-First (G1) garbage collector is a server-style garbage collector, targeted for multiprocessor machines with large memories. It attempts to meet garbage collection (GC) pause time goals with high probability while achieving high throughput.
    <br> The Garbage-First (G1) garbage collector is enabled using the command-line option ```-XX:+UseG1GC```. It is used by default in most launchers including the official one.

- #### Z Garbage Collector
    The Z Garbage Collector, also known as ZGC, is a scalable low latency garbage collector designed to meet sub-millisecond max pause times, pause times that do not increase with the heap size and to handle heaps ranging from 8MB to 16TB in size.
    <br> The Z Garbage Collector is enabled using the command-line option ```-XX:+UseZGC```. It isnâ€™t supported in Java 8, so only use it for Minecraft versions 1.17 and above.

- #### Shenandoah Garbage Collector
    Shenandoah is the low pause time garbage collector that reduces GC pause times by performing more garbage collection work concurrently with the running Java program. Shenandoah does the bulk of GC work concurrently, including the concurrent compaction, which means its pause times are no longer directly proportional to the size of the heap. Garbage collecting a 200 GB heap, or a 2 GB heap should have the similar low pause behaviour. 
    <br> The Shenandoah GC is enabled using the command-line option ```-XX:+UseShenandoahGC```. It does not ship in Oracle JDK builds, so you will have to use other vendors for your JDK builds like AdoptOpenJDK and Azul.

<br> For me the Shenandoah GC works best but I would recommend that you try all of them and see which works best on your system.

<br> There is also one more JVM argument that is common to all garbage collectors;
- ### MaxGCPauseMillis
    The goal for the maximum pause time for clearing memory. It is set to 50 by default in the official Minecraft Launcher.

<hr>

These are probably the only JVM flags you will ever need to change. Be careful when messing around with JVM flags as making some changes could cause Minecraft to crash on start-up.
