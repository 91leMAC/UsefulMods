## Extra Information
You might find small numbers around the gist that look like this(¹,²,³,⁴,⁵,⁶) these are used to tell extra information
&nbsp;

###### ¹ Should work if [Mixin-0-7-0-8-Compatibility](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-0-7-0-8-compatibility) is applied. 
###### ² Cull Particles isn't needed anymore in newer Forge versions, it was implemented in forge.
###### ³ Do not blame me if you didn't read this notice, *if you try to load a older world in a newer instance of the game, and you have one of these mods installed, bad things will happen*, uninstall the mod first.
###### ⁴ Some of the mods that have Sodium as an incompatibility, might work if you use [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium)
###### ⁵ AI Improvements newer versions (1.14+) don't have as much impact as the older versions have, since in newer versions of Minecraft, a lot of fixes to the AI are implemented [Sources: Curseforge page FAQ, [Dev](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/254806806516203520/831525756143534150/unknown.png)]
###### ⁶ Halogen has issues with forge's ExplosionEvent, see [sodium-forge#33](https://github.com/spoorn/sodium-forge/issues/33).
